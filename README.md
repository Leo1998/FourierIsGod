# FourierIsGod


This is an experiment for using complex (and hypercomplex) fourier transform to model 2d paths.
-The 2d version works just like in the video by 3Blue1Brown (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sGWTCMz2k)
-The 3d version is an attemt to reproduce the same concept with a 3d path where the coefficients of the fourier transform are quaternions. A way to solve this is still to be found, but i managed to model a 3d paths that lies completly on the 3d unit sphere.
